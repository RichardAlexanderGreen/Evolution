Evolution
=========

Simulate evolution via mutation. Demo: Evolve a stock-investment strategy.

The ".st" file is created by a FileOut command from a Squeak Smalltalk image.
It can be loaded into any Squeak (or Squeak fork such as Pharo, Seaside, . . .) 
via a FileIn command.

WARNING: I did this as an exercise to satisfy a coding itch.
I do not recommend that you actually use the strategies created for actual investments.

The example was designed to run with daily stock closing price data.
Daily stock closing data is not included. 
You may obtain such data from several sources at a reasonable price.
